## Description

In contrast to traditional data processing systems that provide one dedicated execution engine, Apache Wayang (incubating) can transparently and seamlessly integrate multiple execution engines and use them to perform a single task. We call this *cross-platform data processing*. In Wayang, users can specify any data processing application using one of Wayang's APIs and then Wayang will choose the data processing platform(s), e.g., Postgres or Apache Spark, that best fits the application. Finally, Wayang will perform the execution, thereby hiding the different platform-specific APIs and coordinating inter-platform communication.

Apache Wayang (incubating) aims at freeing data engineers and software developers from the burden of learning all different data processing systems, their APIs, strengths and weaknesses; the intricacies of coordinating and integrating different processing platforms; and the inflexibility when trying a fixed set of processing platforms. As of now, Wayang has built-in support for the following processing platforms:
- [Java Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/)
- [Apache Giraph](https://giraph.apache.org/)
- [GraphChi](https://github.com/GraphChi/graphchi-java)
- [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

Apache Wayang (incubating) can be used via the following APIs:
- Java native
- Java scala-like
- Scala
- SQL (limited support of simple select-project queries for now)

## Quick Guide for Running Wayang

For a quick guide on how to run WordCount see [here](guides/tutorial.md).

## Quick Guide for Developing with Wayang

For a quick guide on how to use Wayang in your Java/Scala project see [here](guides/develop-with-Wayang.md).

## Installing Wayang

You first have to build the binaries as shown [here](guides/tutorial.md).
Once you have the binaries built, follow these steps to install Wayang:

```shell
tar -xvf wayang-0.6.1-snapshot.tar.gz
cd wayang-0.6.1-SNAPSHOT
```

In linux
```shell 
echo "export WAYANG_HOME=$(pwd)" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=${PATH}:${WAYANG_HOME}/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
In MacOS
```shell 
echo "export WAYANG_HOME=$(pwd)" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export PATH=${PATH}:${WAYANG_HOME}/bin" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Requirements at Runtime

Since Apache Wayang (incubating) is not an execution engine itself but rather manages the execution engines for you, it is important to have the necessary requirements installed.

- Apache Wayang supports Java versions 8 and above. However, the Wayang team recommends using Java version 11. Don’t forget to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
- You need to install Apache Spark version 3 or higher. Don’t forget to set the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable.
- You need to install Apache Hadoop version 3 or higher. Don’t forget to set the `HADOOP_HOME` environment variable.

### Validating the installation

To execute your first application with Apache Wayang, you need to execute your program with the 'wayang-submit' command:

```shell
bin/wayang-submit org.apache.wayang.apps.wordcount.Main java file://$(pwd)/README.md
```

## Getting Started

Wayang is available via Maven Central. To use it with Maven, include the following code snippet into your POM file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.wayang</groupId>
  <artifactId>wayang-***</artifactId>
  <version>0.6.0</version>
</dependency>
```
Note the `***`: Wayang ships with multiple modules that can be included in your app, depending on how you want to use it:
* `wayang-core`: provides core data structures and the optimizer (required)
* `wayang-basic`: provides common operators and data types for your apps (recommended)
* `wayang-api-scala-java_2.12`: provides an easy-to-use Scala and Java API to assemble Wayang plans (recommended)
* `wayang-java`, `wayang-spark`, `wayang-graphchi`, `wayang-sqlite3`, `wayang-postgres`: adapters for the various supported processing platforms
* `wayang-profiler`: provides functionality to learn operator and UDF cost functions from historical execution data

> **NOTE:** The module `wayang-api-scala-java_2.12` is intended to be used with Java 11 and Scala 2.12. If you have the Java 8 version, you need to use the `wayang-api-scala-java_2.11` module.


For the sake of version flexibility, you still have to include in the POM file your Hadoop (`hadoop-hdfs` and `hadoop-common`) and Spark (`spark-core` and `spark-graphx`) version of choice.

In addition, you can obtain the most recent snapshot version of Wayang via Sonatype's snapshot repository. Just include:
```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>apache-snapshots</id>
    <name>Apache Foundation Snapshot Repository</name>
    <url>https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Prerequisites
Apache Wayang (incubating) is built with Java 11 and Scala 2.12. However, to run Apache Wayang it is sufficient to have just Java 11 installed. Please also consider that processing platforms employed by Wayang might have further requirements.
```
Java 11
[Scala 2.12]
```

> **NOTE:** Wayang also works with Java 8 and Scala 2.11. If you want to use these versions, you will have to re-build Wayang (see below).

> **NOTE:** In windows, you need to define the variable `HADOOP_HOME` with the winutils.exe, an not official option to obtain [this repository](https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils), or you can generate your winutils.exe following the instructions in the repository. Also, you may need to install [msvcr100.dll](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999)

> **NOTE:** Make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly to either Java 8 or Java 11 as the prerequisite checker script currently supports up to Java 11 and checks the latest version of Java if you have higher version installed. In Linux, it is preferably to use the export JAVA_HOME method inside the project folder. It is also recommended running './mvnw clean install' before opening the project using IntelliJ.


### Building

If you need to rebuild Wayang, e.g., to use a different Scala version, you can simply do so via Maven:

1. Adapt the version variables (e.g., `spark.version`) in the main `pom.xml` file.
2. Build Wayang with the adapted versions.
    ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-wayang.git
   cd incubator-wayang
   ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
    ```
> **NOTE:** If you receive an error about not finding `MathExBaseVisitor`, then the problem might be that you are trying to build from IntelliJ, without Maven. MathExBaseVisitor is generated code, and a Maven build should generate it automatically.

> **NOTE:** In the current Maven setup, the version of scala is tied to the Java version, you can compile the profile `scala-11` with Java 8 and profile `scala-12` with Java 11.

> **NOTE:** For compiling and testing the code it is required to have Hadoop installed on your machine.

> **NOTE:**  the `standalone` profile to fix Hadoop and Spark versions, so that Wayang apps do not explicitly need to declare the corresponding dependencies.
>
> Also, note the `distro` profile, which assembles a binary Wayang distribution.
To activate these profiles, you need to specify them when running maven, i.e.,

```shell
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -P<profile name> 
```

## Running the tests
In the incubator-wayang root folder run:
```shell
./mvnw test
```

## Example Applications
You can see examples on how to start using Wayang [here](guides/wayang-examples.md)
