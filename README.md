### What is Rheem?

Rheem is an agile distributed data processing framework developed by the data analytic group at [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://da.qcri.org). It has three distinctive features:
1. it allows users to easily specify their jobs with easy-to-use interfaces,
2. it provides developers with opportunities to optimize performance in different ways, and
3. it can run on any execution platform, such as Spark or MapReduce and combinations of those.

### Prerequisite

To be able to run and compile Rheem, the following software is needed.
- [Java 1.8](http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/develop.xml)
- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org)
- Platforms to be employed (as of now Java and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/))
