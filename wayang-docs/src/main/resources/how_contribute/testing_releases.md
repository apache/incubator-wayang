# Testing Releases

Wayangâ€™s release process is community-oriented, and members of the community can vote on new releases on the [email list@dev](mailto:dev@wayang.apache.org). Wayang users are invited to subscribe to the email list \#Dev to receive announcements, and test their workloads on newer release and provide feedback on any performance or correctness issues found in the newer release.
