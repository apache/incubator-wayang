# wayang-api-python (Java Components)

## PythonAPI.java
- This class appears to be a placeholder or an entry point for the Python API functionalities from the Java side.
- Currently contains an empty method called `empty()`, suggesting it might be in the early stages of development or serves as a stub.

## function directory
- Likely contains Java classes related to Python functions or function interfaces.
- A deeper dive into this directory will provide insights into specific functionalities and interactions.

## executor directory
- Might house Java classes responsible for executing or managing Python tasks.
- Further analysis of this directory will shed light on its components and their roles.

These classes and interfaces in the `function` directory facilitate the interaction between Java and Python within the Wayang framework, particularly for executing Python functions and code snippets.
