### Class Definition
The `PythonWorkerManager` class manages the execution of Python UDFs within the Wayang framework. It handles Python worker subprocesses, feeding them input data, and potentially receiving results.

### Attributes:
1. **udf (PythonUDF<Input, Output>)**: The Python user-defined function that this worker manager is set to execute.
2. **serializedUDF (PythonCode)**: Holds a serialized representation of the Python UDF.
3. **inputIterator (Iterable<Input>)**: Represents an iterable over the input data for the Python UDF.

### Constructor:
- `PythonWorkerManager(PythonUDF<Input, Output> udf, PythonCode serializedUDF, Iterable<Input> input)`:
  - Initializes the worker manager with a Python UDF, its serialized version, and input data.
  - Assigns the provided parameters to the respective class attributes.

### Methods:
1. **execute()**:
   - Creates an instance of the `PythonProcessCaller` class with the serialized UDF.
   - If the worker (Python process) is ready, it does the following:
     - Sets up a `ProcessFeeder` to feed input data to the Python process in a separate thread.
     - Sets up a `ProcessReceiver` to receive the results from the Python process.
     - Returns an iterable over the received data.
   - If the worker is not ready, throws a `WayangException`.
