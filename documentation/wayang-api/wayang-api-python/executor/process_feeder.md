### Class Definition
The `ProcessFeeder` class feeds input data to a Python process for execution within the Wayang framework. It ensures proper serialization of data and manages socket communication for data transmission.

### Attributes:
1. **socket (Socket)**: Socket for communication with the Python process.
2. **udf (PythonUDF<Input, Output>)**: The Python user-defined function to be executed by the process.
3. **serializedUDF (PythonCode)**: Serialized representation of the Python UDF.
4. **input (Iterable<Input>)**: Iterable over the input data for the Python UDF.

### Constructor:
- `ProcessFeeder(Socket socket, PythonUDF<Input, Output> udf, PythonCode serializedUDF, Iterable<Input> input)`:
  - Initializes the feeder with socket, UDF, serialized UDF, and input data.
  - Throws a `WayangException` if input is null.

### Methods:
1. **send()**:
   - Sends serialized UDF and input data to the Python process over a socket.
   - Writes `END_OF_DATA_SECTION` value to indicate the end of data.

2. **writeUDF(PythonCode serializedUDF, DataOutputStream dataOut)**:
   - Writes serialized UDF to the provided data output stream.

3. **writeIteratorToStream(Iterator<Input> iter, DataOutputStream dataOut)**:
   - Writes each item from the iterator to the data output stream.
