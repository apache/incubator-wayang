## Edge Object
- This object offers helper functions for handling `Edge` instances in a graph.

### Key Methods:
1. **apply(src: Long, dest: Long)**
   - Creates a new edge by specifying the source and target vertex identifiers.
   - Parameters: `src` (source vertex), `dest` (target vertex).
   - Return: A new instance of the `Edge` class.

### Observations:
- The `Edge` object provides a utility method for creating new edges.
- The implementation is straightforward with a focus on edge creation.
